# SimpleRecyclerView
This is a very simple RecyclerView project which contains both offline and online (Firebase Firestore) list displaying. Adding it here for the newbies to understand RecyclerView and its working method :)

> You must need to [create a Firebase project](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+get+firebase+google-services.json) create a Firebase project and download the google-service.json file, add it inside the 'app' folder to run the project, otherwise AS will just throws error at you and won't run the app or build the APK!!
