# SimpleRecyclerView
This is a very simple RecyclerView project which contains both offline and online (Firebase Firestore) list displaying. Adding it here for the newbies to understand RecyclerView and its working method :)

> You must need to [create a Firebase project](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+get+firebase+google-services.json) and download the google-service.json file, add it inside the 'app' folder of the project, otherwise Android Studio will just throws error at you and won't let you run the app or build the APK!!
